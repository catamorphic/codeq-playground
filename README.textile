h1. Codeq Playground

A quick and easy way to play around with queries against your clojure
git repositories.

h2. Requirements

* "Leiningen 2.0+":https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

h2. Get Started

* @git clone http://github.com/devn/codeq-playground.git@
* @cd codeq-playground@
* @script/bootstrap@
* @script/start-datomic@ to start up Datomic
* @script/analyze-repo my/clojure/repo-name datomic-db-name@

h2. Examples

"codeq-playground":https://github.com/devn/codeq-playground includes a few examples of what you can do with Codeq.
They're stolen liberally from the Codeq "blog post":http://blog.datomic.com/2012/10/codeq.html and from Rich Hickey's
unsession talk on Codeq at "Clojure/conj 2012":http://clojure-conj.org/

Once you've run `script/analyze-repo` on a Clojure git repository, jump in and try
out some of the examples in `core.clj`.
